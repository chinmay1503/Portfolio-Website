        "details": "Chinmay came onboard Client Systems Administration team as a student employee. I've found over the years it's difficult to hire students who have IT experience and attention to detail needed to build objects used in client management. With Chinmay I feel that he not only has the attention to detail, but keen insight to improve many of our existing processes. I could train him to use some of Microsoft's most complex client management tools with ease to manage several thousand clients. I also trained him to use JAMF Pro made by JAMF to manage Mac clients as well. Chinmay's quality of work and excellent technical skills help drive project success at the university."
